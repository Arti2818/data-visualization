In my Jupyter Notebook analysis, I seamlessly combined Tableau for dynamic and interactive data visualizations with Python code to investigate the relationships between heart disease and various living habits and factors, leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle. After collect, clean, preprossesing the Tableau visualizations allowed for intuitive exploration of the dataset, highlighting patterns and correlations in the data. Simultaneously, through Python code, I focused on showcasing how heart disease correlates with specific living habits. This hybrid approach facilitated a comprehensive examination, enabling a deeper understanding of the dataset by integrating the power of Tableau for visualization and Python for analytical insights.
